# mempyfit

The goal of this package is to provide basic functioanlity to prob dynamic ecotoxicological models using different methods.

This package has primarily been developed for teaching purposes at University Osnabrück and for the PhD school *Dynamic Modelling of Toxic Effects* hosted by University of Copenhagen. 

The functionality of the package is currently mostly limited to what is useful for these courses, although I can envision further development in the future.
For a more comprehensive package, consider checking out [pymob](https://github.com/flo-schu/pymob). 

Contributions are welcome (open an Issue or contact me directly). 

You can install the package using the repo URL and pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/simonhansul/mempyfit
```

Usage is described in the example notebooks.
